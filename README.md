# Bridging-Humanitarian-Mapping-and-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals
SDGs indicators and HM potentials for SDGs contribution dataset.

The data was used in the article: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi14080307

We have strictly adhered to the process outlined in the article. This includes:

* Download the SDG indicators from https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/ and check the potential contribution of each indicator to humanitarian mapping (the data is shown in the appendix and attached to this email, see 'SDG Analysis - Selected-Indicators.csv').
* Extract and filter humanitarian mapping projects from three platforms (see 'SDG-HM-Project-Monitor-250710*HumanitarianMappingPlatform*_Filtered.csv').
* Manually classify the potential contribution of each HM project to the SDGs (see '250710-HM-Project-SDGs-indicator-classification.csv')
