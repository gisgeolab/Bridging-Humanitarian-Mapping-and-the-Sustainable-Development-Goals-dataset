Particularly the Sokoto Noma Hospital, with a programme of activities for people affected by Noma, including Noma survivors and their families. Noma, a neglected and little-known non-contagious disease, mostly affects children under five living in poverty. It starts as an inflammation of the gums, similar to a small mouth ulcer. In just two weeks the infection starts to destroy bone and tissue, potentially affecting the jaw, lips, cheeks, nose or eyes, leaving survivors with physical consequences including pain, breathing complications and difficulties eating. Noma has a strikingly high mortality rate, and those who do survive are left with life-changing facial disfigurements. Four times a year, a team of international surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses travel to Sokoto Noma Hospital to operate on Noma survivors. The hospital, run in collaboration with the Nigerian Ministry of Health, also focuses on community outreach, active case finding in the region, health promotion and mental health support.

Particularly the Sokoto Noma Hospital, with a programme of activities for people affected by Noma, including Noma survivors and their families. Noma, a neglected and little-known non-contagious disease, mostly affects children under five living in poverty. It starts as an inflammation of the gums, similar to a small mouth ulcer. In just two weeks the infection starts to destroy bone and tissue, potentially affecting the jaw, lips, cheeks, nose or eyes, leaving survivors with physical consequences including pain, breathing complications and difficulties eating. Noma has a strikingly high mortality rate, and those who do survive are left with life-changing facial disfigurements.
